# Pokemon Living Dex Project


## Current Goals: 
- Set up info for Pokedex to be functional -- with manual editing. Have info on each pokemon (location, evolutions, etc.)
- Screen capture for auto logging of a given pokemon to be caught
- -Can lock in next desired pokemon or randomize / can also put into evolution mode based on who you have caught
- -Can display who is still left in the area, can click on pokemon for more specific info like spawn rates. Can expand the area for more details on exact locations within this map UI
as well as spawn rates and location 
- Adding and verifying current progress (scanned via home or boxes)

## Currently focusing on Sword/Shield for early development 
- Need big spreadsheet with Pokemon info (all pokemon, forms, regional, gender, etc.) -- as well as evolution relationships (source to evolve) will be basis for Pokedex UI and info
- Need spreadsheet on locations and spawn rates/games they are in. Weather restrictions, event restrictions
- Each location will have more info as well, pokemon that can spawn in them, areas of the spawns, etc. (Advanced feature)
- Will keep track of locations you enter via the top right flag change - Will be able to provide area specific info in that case (pokemon left) as well as more specific spawn info 
- Toggle based on selected game and starting location
- Problem : gigantmax...
