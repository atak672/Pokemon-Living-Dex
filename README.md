# Pokemon Living Dex Project


## Current Goals: 
- Set up info for Pokedex to be functional -- with manual editing. Have info on each pokemon (location, evolutions, etc.)
- Screen capture for auto logging of a given pokemon to be caught
- -Can lock in next desired pokemon or randomize / can also put into evolution mode based on who you have caught
- -Can display who is still left in the area as well as spawn rates and location 
- Adding and verifying current progress (scanned via home or boxes)

## Currently focusing on Sword/Shield for early development 
- Need big spreadsheet with Pokemon info (all pokemon, forms, regional, gender, etc.) -- as well as evolution relationships (source to evolve) will be basis for Pokedex UI and info
- Need spreadsheet on locations and spawn rates/games they are in. Weather restrictions, event restrictions
- Each location will have more info as well, pokemon that can spawn in them, areas of the spawns, etc. (Advanced feature)
- Problem : gigantmax...
